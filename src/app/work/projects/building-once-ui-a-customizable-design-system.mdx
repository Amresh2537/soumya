Overview
At Infovibes, we built a highly customizable business automation system to serve diverse operational needs—from task management and CRM to reporting and communication. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and easily tailored to fit different business workflows.

Key Features
Modular Automation Library: Developed a library of pre-built automation modules (leads, follow-ups, inventory, reports, etc.) that can be quickly deployed and customized.

Theme-Based Control Panels: Created dashboards with adjustable themes and layouts to align with brand identity and user preferences.

Real-Time Data Sync: Integrated Google Sheets, Forms, and Apps Script for live data updates, team collaboration, and zero-lag workflows.

User Access & Role Permissions: Implemented a flexible permissions system so different departments can view and manage only what's relevant to them.

Documentation & Training Tools: Included onboarding guides and interactive walkthroughs for easy adoption across organizations.

Technologies Used
Google Apps Script: For scripting custom workflows and backend logic.

Next.js & HTML/CSS: For building dynamic UIs and responsive control panels.

Google Workspace: As the ecosystem for managing forms, sheets, and emails.

Looker Studio: For powerful and visual data reporting.

WhatsApp API / Email: For real-time communication and alerts.

Challenges and Learnings
One of the main challenges was designing the system to be both robust and flexible—suitable for small teams as well as enterprise-level operations. We achieved this through reusable architecture and a plug-and-play model for feature sets. We also learned the importance of simplifying the user interface for non-tech users, which significantly improved adoption and usability.

Outcome
The system is currently deployed across multiple industries—manufacturing, retail, services—helping clients reduce manual tasks, track team activities in real time, and make faster decisions. It has laid the foundation for digital transformation and data-driven growth across businesses.
